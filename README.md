# Fifa-42
This is the first game that was created by me along with a couple of my friends. It is written in ANSI C++ and works only on a console.
It is a 9v9 Football game where you compete against the computer. 

## Installation 
* Download Turbo C++ from [here](https://developerinsider.co/download-turbo-c-for-windows-7-8-8-1-and-windows-10-32-64-bit-full-screen/).
* Open Turbo C++ and navigate to fifa_42.CPP
* Compile the file and enjoy the game!

## The game
Once the program is compiled, the user is presented with a menu, you can use the left/right keys to toggle the menu.

### Basic layout
Once you click on the play button, a football field appears.
Your team members are white circles while the opponent team members are blue circles. You are the yellow circle. 

### Controls
* Use arrow keys to move your player
* Use the ```QWE, ASD, ZXC``` keys for passing the ball in an appropriate direction
* In game, use the ```space``` key to toggle Position holding (whether your players return to their original positions)
* Pause the game by pressing the ```esc``` key
* Once in the pause menu, formations can be changed using the ```space``` key followed by the left/right arrow keys
