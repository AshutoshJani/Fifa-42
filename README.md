# Fifa-42 - Reborn!
A modern port of a beloved game me and a couple of friends wrote.  
I also intend to convert this into a full blown online game along with a realistic AI.

## Features
- [ ] Create a basic python port (using PyGame for now)
- [ ] Convert to a static online game
- [ ] Train AI using Reinforcement Learning (super hard)
